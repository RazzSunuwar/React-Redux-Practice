React Redux + Hooks
React Redux pattern
Action creators, reducers, provide the store and connect the components.
Components can access state and dispatch actions
Reacts Hooks
React Redux v7.1
Subscribe to store and dispatch actions without connections()



Actions 

Synchronous Actions
As soon as an action was dispatched, the state was immediately updated.
If you dispatch the BUY_CAKE action, the numOfCakes was right away decremented by 1.
Same with BUY_ICECREM action as well.


Async Actions
Asychronous API calls to fetch data from an end point and use that and use that data in your
application.
